# Scenario, you are running out of disk space on a Linux VM and need to increase the disk size.  
# You shut done the VM and increase the disk size by 100GB in the Type 1 Hypervisor and reboot the VM
# Now you need to extend the added space to the existing filesystem...

# Look at the filesystem in huma readable terms
df -h

# List the block volumes
lsblk

# List the physical volumes
pvdisplay

# List the logical volumes
lvdisplay

# Evaluate free space on a logical volume
parted /dev/nvme0n1 print free

# Create new partition out of the free space
fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
# choose n
# choose p
# choose w

# Now look to can see the new partition /dev/nvme0n1p4
parted /dev/nvme0n1 print free
# nvme0n1p4 will be available with the remaining disk space used

# Create the new physical volume from the new partition /dev/nvme0n1p4
pvcreate /dev/nvme0n1p4

# Notice that there's no volume group (VG) designated for the new physical volume. 
# Extend the same volume group from the original physical volume to cover the new physical volume.
vgextend centos /dev/nvme0n1p4


# Now because the space in the new physical volume is covered under the same volume group that all the existing 
# logical volumes (like root and home) are under, we can extend those logical volumes with the additional space (growing the filesystem). 
# Add 10GB to /dev/centos/home logical volume as an example.
lvextend -L+10G /dev/centos/home

# or give all of the free space to /home
lvextend -l+100%FREE /dev/centos/home

# Grow the filesystem for that logical volume so you can actually use the space on /dev/centos/home.
xfs_growfs /dev/centos/home
# on older Linux filesystems, use resize2fs /dev/centos/home

# Verify new disk size
df -h
