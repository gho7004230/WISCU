#  Nearly all Linux distributions use a similar directory structure, and Linux distribution vendors have generally agreed on the naming and location of critical Linux files and directories.  A good knowledge of the Linux file system pays dividends to pretty much every system administrator. Because you have full control (through the root or super-user account), this cinformation is invaluable in keeping your system running smoothly and securely.
